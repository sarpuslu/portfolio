## Introduction
This is a little project I've been working on to learn front-end development with React. On this website users can view their portfolio and make trades. The idea here is to build a React website that works with async http requests to fetch/update data and present the data using Javascript charting frameworks (such as agGrid and HighCharts).

## How to run?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`

Start the mock server that serves the JSON trades data used across the project. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
